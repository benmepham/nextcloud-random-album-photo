# Nextcloud Random Photo from Album

NodeJS (Express) API to get a random photo from a Nextcloud album. For example for using with [lovelace-wallpanel](https://github.com/j-a-n/lovelace-wallpanel).

Would not have been possible without [dav-slideshow](https://github.com/Half-Shot/dav-slideshow)

## Setup

- populate `.env` based on `.env.sample`
- `npm i`

## Docker
